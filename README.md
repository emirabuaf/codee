#### What we value
We don't care whether you're done in 2 hours or take 7 hours to complete the tasks below. Here's a brief overview of what we'd like to see in your submission →
Try to stick to what you'd want to see in "production-level code". This means structuring your code in a maintainable way and adopting coding conventions that we use. Specifically, we would advise that you:
1. use TypeScript
2. Use StyledComponents for styling
3. Split logic to smaller components
4. think of using React Context API
5. try to avoid using class component (use functional components with hooks instead)
